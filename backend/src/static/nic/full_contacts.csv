As you may have noticed, I have revamped my profile in the last few days and wanted to share some news. I am very excited to announce that I have launched my pitching and sales coaching business earlier this year. Helping entrepreneurs to create and deliver a clear and impactful pitch with full confidence to win clients and investors. After the success of my initial Facebook announcement that many of you will have seen a number of months ago, I‚Äôm excited to share this with the Linkedin community.  For the last 5+ years I‚Äôve worked in business development and sales with a variety of start-ups and businesses, developing a passion for bringing new and exciting products /services to market. I‚Äôve enjoyed success in helping new businesses acquire their first customers, build a strong and sustainable customer base, and been a part of tremendous and exciting growth as the products I‚Äôve sold became market leaders and the companies I‚Äôve worked with doubled, tripled and even quadrupled in size.  Looking back on this incredible period of my life and thinking about what drove me everyday, I always come back to same point‚Ä¶ Pitching! Being in front of high level executives armed with nothing but a pitch deck and my voice. ¬†Nailing a presentation that makes the audience think and question the way they‚Äôve been doing things for years. It‚Äôs the part of my work that I‚Äôve enjoyed the most and the part that both scares and excites me.  Having recently started working online and travelling full time I‚Äôve been lucky enough to meet hundreds of talented entrepreneurs with diverse backgrounds from software development to restaurants. All of these people‚Äôs backgrounds enable them to have incredible ideas and build amazing products / services to share with the world. Many however have little to no experience in sales and pitching making it harder to consistently attract the right people to grow their business.  My business is therefore created with intention of filling this gap and enabling anyone with a great idea to be able to pitch with confidence to attract the right people to fuel their business growth. I believe that being able to deliver a clear and impactful pitch is the bedrock of any business growth and I‚Äôm excited to share my knowledge as a pitch coach.  I currently have space for 5 new entrepreneurs/ business owners (people with whom we both vibe and who are serious about taking their business to the next level). So if you want to be part of the 5 or know someone who could benefit from this, let's chat on private message first (feel free to PM me), I will be more than happy to help.\n      \n    \n  \n            \n          ‚Ä¶more\n            \n  \n          \n\n    \n  \n\n              \n    \n      \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                      Activate to view larger image,\n                    \n                  \n    \n        \n    \n\n          \n    \n  \n          \n  \n                \n                      \n        \n              Activate to view larger image,\n"",""image"":""""},{""actor"":""Simon Blake"",""desc"":""Sterling advises us on all things food safety and this will be a great webinar for anyone interested in sustainability!"",""age"":"""",""content"":""Sterling CrewSterling Crew\n              \n                \n                     ‚Ä¢ 2nd ‚Ä¢ 2nd\n                \n            \n\n              \n                  Chair of the Food Authenticity Network - Fighting food fraud..Chair of the Food Authenticity Network - Fighting food fraud..\n              \n\n          \n              \n                \n                    4yr ‚Ä¢ Edited ‚Ä¢ \n      \n     4 years ago\n                \n              \n        \n      \n\n        \n    \n          \n    \n    \n\n\n        Follow\n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n\n                \n    \n          \n            \n    \n      \n              \n    \n\n      \n          FOOD WASTE, COVID19 & CLIMATE CHANGE: I am looking forward to presenting at the RSPH webinar looking at the global scale of food waste, its impact on the environment and how this quantity of food could potentially feed those who are hungry and the impact of COVID19.There will be a discussion about how food waste is a disaster for the environment. It takes land larger than China to grow the food each year that is wasted. If the food waste goes to landfill, it can decompose in conditions without oxygen creating methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In the UK, the average family throws away 22% of their weekly shop, which is worth ¬£800 per year and this has been made dramatically worse by the Covid-19 pandemic. Potentially the 1 in 9 people on the planet who are starving or malnourished could be sufficiently fed on less than a quarter of the food that is wasted in the UK, Europe and the USA each year. There will also be a discussion of the use of the free app OLIO, This webinar will be of interest to anybody who wants to learn more about the reduction of food waste.Do join Lisa and I at 1.00pm on Tuesday 26 May.
